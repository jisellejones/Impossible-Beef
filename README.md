# Impossible-Beef

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to create a web page where participants in a study can use their unique subject ID to see the types of bacteria residing in their navel. If Improbable Beef (an imagined company) identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, participants will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
